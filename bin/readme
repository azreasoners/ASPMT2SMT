An input encoding consists of a declaration section and a set of multi-valued propositional rules.
The declaration includes sort declarations, object declarations, constant declarations, and variable 
declarations. These define the names of the user-defined sorts, the elements in the sorts, the argument and value sorts for constants, and the sorts of variables respectively. See the examples for details on syntax.


The multi-valued propositional rules are formed using the constants, variables, objects, and propositional
connectives, which include & (conjunction), | (disjunction), -> (implication), <- (reverse direction
implication), not (negation). See the examples for more detailed usage.


Typical invocation of the toolchain script will be 

aspmt2smt <FILENAME> <CONSTANTS>

where <FILENAME> is the name of the input file, <CONSTANTS> are of the form "-c <CONST>=<VALUE>".

See the example outputs for specific examples of the invocations.



Versions used for external tools in the toolchain:

f2lp: v1.3
gringo: v3.0.4
z3: v4.3.2
